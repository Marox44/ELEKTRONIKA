MMA7455 3-axis Accelerometer AVR Atmega library.
MMA7455 is a very low power 3 axis digital accelerometer from Freescale
Semiconductors. It's micro machined nano structure is capable of measuring
acceleration along its X, Y and Z axes.

User can setup sensitivity to 8bit, or 10bit, and measurement mode to 2/4/8G.
You should calibrate the sensor before use it, to calibrate it collect values
placing the accellerometer on every position of an ideal cube and then edit
calibration offset values.

Setup parameters can be found in file mma7455.h
